      <p class=" a3"> Our national flag is the symbol of our independence and sovereignty. We got independence through a bloody liberation war and we have lost millions of lives in the war. That is how we earn our national flag. This is a matter of our emotions and pride. Every independent country in the world has its own national flag. We also have our national flag which is rectangular. There is a certain ratio to make our national flag. Its length and width ratio should be 10:6. It can be made of different materials like cotton, silk or linen. The rectangular background is green in color. There is a circle inside the rectangle and that is red in color. There are some reasons for this color scheme. The green background reminds us of our green motherland. As we are a country with green lands and crops everywhere, this green background is the symbol of our land. It is also the symbol of our evergreen youth that want to take the country far. It also reminds us of the valiant struggle of our evergreen youth that gave us independence. The red circle in the middle is the symbol of the glowing sun that gives energy to all of us. It also has another symbolic meaning that is tragic. We have lost millions of lives during our liberation war and our motherland has been freed from the oppressors in the cost of their blood. This is remembered while designing our national flag and Kamrul Hasan is the designer of our national flag. This red circle reminds us of the bloodshed that happened to give us an independent and sovereign country. There are certain laws regarding our national flag. It should always be made in proper ratio and it should never be torn. Our national flag is hoisted on top of all government buildings, courts and offices, educational institutions. It is hoisted in the morning and retracted in the evening. Our national flag must not be hoisted at night. Our national flag remains half-mast during any national holiday and no other flags should be hoisted on top of our national flag. It is a great honor and pride for us to have an independent country and our national flag as the symbol of our independence. We should always be careful to keep its honor upright and bear the moral.</p>
